# Week 11 Trees - Binary Search Tree Example

## Objective

The Week 11 Trees project demonstrates the creation and traversal of a binary search tree (BST) using generic types in Java. The program inserts integer values into the tree and prints the tree structure.

### Skills Learned

- Implementing a generic Binary Search Tree (BST) in Java.
- Inserting nodes in a BST while maintaining the order property.
- Traversing and printing tree structures.
- Understanding hierarchical data storage and tree-based algorithms.

### Tools Used

- Java programming language.
- Custom `Tree` class for BST operations.
- Array manipulation for inserting multiple values into the tree.

## Steps

1. Create an instance of `Tree<Integer>` to store integer values.
2. Define an array of integers: `{10, 20, 5, 15, 25, 30, 2, 8, 18, 12}`.
3. Insert each value into the tree using the `insert()` method.
4. Print the tree structure using the `printTree()` method to visualize the node arrangement.
